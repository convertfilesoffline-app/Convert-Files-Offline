# Convert Files Offline

**The secure, locally running file conversion app that strives to handle almost any file type**

- **Privacy-first**: Your files never leave your device (they don't get sent to external servers), ensuring security.
- **Wide compatibility**: Convert between a vast range of file formats. Currently, almost every video, image, audio or document file type is supported. If you find one that isn't supported, submit to get it added.
- **User-friendly**: With a simple drag and drop GUI interface, you don't need to touch the command-line to use it. Runs on the Web or as Windows app.

**Check it out live on the internet at [converfilesoffline.com](https://convertfilesoffline.com)**
